For clarity, the descriptions below call the first participant as the main participant and the second participant as the assigned participant. \r\n","\r\n","The first 8 attributes in the dataset give information about the participants and their speed date assignment in the whole event. Among these attributes, ones that are not self-explanatory are described below.\r\n","\r\n","```\r\n","iid: Unique participant number,\r\n","pid: Unique assigned partner number\r\n","wave: Number of the session where date took place\r\n","round: Number of people that met in wave\r\n","position: Station number where met partner (You can consider this like table number)\r\n","order: The number of date that night when met partner\r\n","```\r\n","\r\n","After these features, we have the attributes regarding the preferences and scores of both the participant and the other assigned participant. Here, the easiest way to understand whether an attribute is for the main participant or the assigned participant is from the names of these attributes. Attributes including the `_o` in them belong to the assigned participants. To explain this further, below are attributes showing the scores given to the assigned participant by the main participant.\r\n","\r\n","```\r\n","These are score attributes given to assigned partner (from 1 to 10)\r\n","attr: Rating of attractiveness\r\n","sinc: Rating of sincerity\r\n","intel: Rating of intelligence\r\n","fun: Rating of how fun the person is\r\n","amb: Rating of ambitiousness\r\n","shar: Rating of shared interests\r\n","like: Rating of liking the person\r\n","prob: Rating of probability of further dates with the person\r\n","```\r\n","\r\n","As explained above, this time, the following attributes are scores given to the main participant by the assigned participant: `attr_o, sinc_o, intel_o, fun_o, amb_o, shar_o, like_o, prob_o`.\r\n","\r\n","In addition to these features, you will also see numbered features like `attr2_1` or `sinc3_1`. For these features, the first number denotes the context of these attributes. Below, you can see the questions asked to participants for these attributes.\r\n","\r\n","```\r\n","Question 1: Please rate the importance of the following attributes in a potential date.\r\n","(Total 100 points are distributed among features below.)\r\n","  - attr1_1, sinc1_1, intel1_1, fun1_1, amb1_1, shar1_1 are responses of participants to the Question 1\r\n","\r\n","Question 2: What do you think the opposite sex looks for in a date?\r\n","(Total 100 points are distributed among features below.)\r\n","  - attr2_1, sinc2_1, intel2_1, fun2_1, amb2_1, shar2_1 are responses of participants to the Question 2\r\n","\r\n","Question 3: How do you think you measure up?\r\n","(From 1 to 10 for each feature)\r\n","  - attr3_1, sinc3_1, intel3_1, fun3_1, amb3_1, shar3_1 are responses of participants to the Question 3\r\n","```\r\n","\r\n","The second number denotes the time of feature being recorded. As these features are recorded multiple times during and after the event, \r\n","in the original dataset there are features with different record times. In our simplified version, we only selected the initial answers of these individuals, so that the second number in these features are always 1.  \r\n","\r\n","Additionally, there are features coded as `pf_o_attr, pf_o_sin, pf_o_int, pf_o_fun, pf_o_amb, pf_o_sha`. These features denote the initial preferences of the assigned participant in a potential date *(Total 100 points are distributed among features)*.\r\n","\r\n","Most of the features in the dataset consist of numeric ordinal values. After establishing the tasks introduced in the Data Preprocessing, the dataset is almost ready to be applied to machine learning models.\r\n","\r\n","In the machine learning part, we will be interested in predicting the decision of the participants' to continue dating the assigned partner. Values for information are stored in the `dec` attribute. Similar to the attributes described earlier, we also have assigned partners' decisions stored in the `dec_o` attribute.\r\n","\r\n","For other features and further information about the attributes, you can visit the Kaggle page for the dataset and check the Data Key file shared there. However, please note that the dataset used in this homework is a simplified format of the original dataset to make your processes easier. Because of this, some of the attributes documented in the Data Key file may not be in the dataset shared with you.\r\n","\r\n","________________________________"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"sp-MELUQATeL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1611348861054,"user_tz":-180,"elapsed":19496,"user":{"displayName":"Alpaslan
